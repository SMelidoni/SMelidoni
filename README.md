### Personal Finance Manager App (PFM) 💰🚀

In a world of countless transactions and expenses, having a personal finance manager is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Hence, I'm developing a Personal Finance Manager App to help users optimise their financial management. Here's what you can expect:

- **Track Income and Expenses:** Keep an eye on every penny coming in or going out 💸
- **Set Monthly Budgets:** Plan ahead, and never overshoot your budget 🎯
- **Visualize Financial Data:** Understand your financial health better with intuitive graphs 📊
- **Monitor Investments and Savings:** Keep your future secure by tracking all your assets 🏦
- **Export Financial Data:** Conveniently export your data for offline usage 📥
- **Secure User Authentication:** Your financial information stays safe with us 🔒

This project utilises the power of:

- React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js
